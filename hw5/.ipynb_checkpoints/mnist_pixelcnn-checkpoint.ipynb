    "### PixelCNN implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is where you will implement the [PixelCNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06759.pdf) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of the PixelCNN is to create a convolutoinal neural network that outputs a probability distribution **at each pixel** conditioned on all the pixels that precede it.  We consider the pixels in the image to be in row-major order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the network outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(x_i|x_1,\\ldots,x_{i-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for each pixel $x_i$.  The predictions are done in parallel; the network takes as input the entire image $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ and outputs $p(x_i|x_1,\\ldots,x_{i-1})$ at each location $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we used a traditional CNN with convolutional filter kernels, the network output at location $i$ would be able to see pixels \"in the future,\" that is, pixels $x_i,\\ldots,x_n$.  To prevent this, we need to **mask** the filter kernels so that they cannot see pixels $x_i,\\ldots,x_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PixelCNN replaces the typical 2D convolution with a **masked** convolution that is not allowed to look at pixels **after** the center pixel under the filter window.  The very first convolution in the network should not look at the center pixel; later convolutions are allowed to look at the center pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The masked convolution is implemented by multiplying the filter kernel with a mask of ones and zeros.  For a $5\\times5$ filter kernel, the mask for the first convolution would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 1 1 1 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1 1 1 1 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1 1 0 0 0\n",
    "\n",
    "0 0 0 0 0\n",
    "\n",
    "0 0 0 0 0\n",
    "\n",
    "and the mask for the remaining convolutions would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 1 1 1 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1 1 1 1 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1 1 1 0 0\n",
    "\n",
    "0 0 0 0 0\n",
    "\n",
    "0 0 0 0 0\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture should have the following pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Masked Conv2D with center pixel masking, 7x7 filter, K outputs + ReLU activation\n",
    "* Repeat N times:\n",
    "Masked Conv2D without center pixel masking, 5x5 filter, K outputs + ReLU activation\n",
    "* Conv2D, 1x1 filter, 1 output + sigmoid activation\n",
    "\n",
    "Use 'same' padding for all convolutions.  The image size (28x28) should not change throughout the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the final 1x1 convolution does not need to be masked, since it only looks at the center pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used N=12, K=32 but you are welcome to experiment with other settings.  The training took ~5 minutes per epoch for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "I provided a partial implementation of the MaskedConv2D layer definition; you need to fill in the part that creates the mask.\n",
