We consider the pixels in the image to be in row-major order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).\n","\n","So, the network outputs\n","\n","$$p(x_i|x_1,\\ldots,x_{i-1})$$\n","\n","for each pixel $x_i$.  The predictions are done in parallel; the network takes as input the entire image $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ and outputs $p(x_i|x_1,\\ldots,x_{i-1})$ at each location $i$.\n","\n","If we used a traditional CNN with convolutional filter kernels, the network output at location $i$ would be able to see pixels \"in the future,\" that is, pixels $x_i,\\ldots,x_n$.  To prevent this, we need to **mask** the filter kernels so that they cannot see pixels $x_i,\\ldots,x_n$.\n","\n","The PixelCNN replaces the typical 2D convolution with a **masked** convolution that is not allowed to look at pixels **after** the center pixel under the filter window.  The very first convolution in the network should not look at the center pixel; later convolutions are allowed to look at the center pixel.\n","\n","The masked convolution is implemented by multiplying the filter kernel with a mask of ones and zeros.
